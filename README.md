# Graphic Design ðŸŽ®

This repository showcases my game development and art portfolio.

## About This Repository

This repository consists of **two fully made video games**. Each game has its own dedicated folder containing a `README.md` file that describes the development, the design process process and gameplay.

**Important Note:** Unfortunately, I've lost the original Unity projects for these games. Therefore, this repository currently includes only downloadable Windows executable files.
