### About the Game

This game was developed as the main project for a bachelor's thesis. In this project, I covered pretty much every aspect of its development: I drew and animated the character and the tile system environment, as well as all present objects using Aseprite. I also composed all the music myself. The entire creation process is described in detail in my Bachelor's thesis, available here https://repozitorij.uni-lj.si/IzpisGradiva.php?id=149857&lang=eng
where I also touch upon copyright and age restriction laws.

### Gameplay

You play as a young girl who loses her mom in a forest. You find and enter a house/gallery, which then locks behind you. On the door, you see a lock/puzzle with 3 missing pieces, which is how you get out. As you look around, you discover three different paintings you can enter. Each painting contains a puzzle and a hint on its side. Completing a puzzle will fill in one piece of the door puzzle.

1.  **The Lights Puzzle:** The goal is to turn all the lights on.
2.  **The Flower Puzzle:** The goal is to resist temptation and keep moving without taking any flowers when prompted (the hint is "Politeness").
3.  **The Vase Puzzle:** The goal is to put all the pieces back into place. *(For simplicity, it is currently set to only 15 pieces to get the puzzle piece.)*

When all three puzzles are completed (regardless of sequence), the girl can leave the gallery and return to her mom.

### Design

For each puzzle the girl enters, I chose to draw her in different styles, mirroring the unique style of each art piece. Each puzzle's environment is, of course, based on the painting you are entering, creating the immersive feeling of stepping into the artwork itself.

The music outside the gallery is the same as inside, but it is slowed down to create suspense. Each melody also represents the essence of its respective painting: nervousness for the time-limited vase puzzle, wintery vibes for the lights puzzle, and a sense of fun and confusion for the flower puzzle.

### Future Improvements

If I were to further explore the idea of entering a painting in a game puzzle context, I would try to match the style of the painting and the girl more closely. I would also greatly improve the UI. For real production, I would, of course, ensure the game is free of glitches.

### Notes

The game has a known glitch: if you fail to complete the Vase puzzle and time runs out, you won't be able to leave.
